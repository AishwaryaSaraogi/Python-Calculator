# Simple Calculator (Python)

A streamlined command-line application designed for performing fundamental arithmetic operations. This project showcases the implementation of functional programming, user input validation, and error handling in Python.

## Features
* *Core Operations:* Supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
* *Smart Error Handling:* Includes a specific validation check to prevent "Division by Zero" errors.
* *Input Validation:* Detects and handles invalid operators to ensure continuous script execution.
* *Floating Point Support:* Capable of processing both integers and decimal numbers for precise calculations.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* *Function Definition:* Encapsulating logic within reusable code blocks.
* *Conditional Logic:* Utilizing if-elif-else structures for decision-making.
* *Arithmetic Operations:* Managing mathematical computations within Python.
* *User Interaction:* Designing a clear and interactive CLI (Command Line Interface).

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the Calculator.py file.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
